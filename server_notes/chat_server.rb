# With the knowledge picked up so far and a small jump in complexity, one can build a practical application (using GServer) such as a simple chat server that allows a number of clients to connect and chat among each other.
# The first step is to subclass GServer into a new class, ChatServer, and override the new method with your own so that you can set up class variables to store client IDs and the chat log for all the clients to share:

# Note Remember that you can specify the hostname to serve from as the second parameter to ChatServer.new. If you want to use this chat server over the Internet, you might need to specify your remotely accessible IP address as this second parameter, otherwise your server might only be available to machines on your local network.

# With the basic GServer principles, you can create servers that operate to protocols of your own design, or even create server programs that can respond to preexisting protocols. All it requires is being able to receive data, process it, and send back the data required by the client. Using these techniques, itâ€™s possible to create a mail server, web server, or any other type of server necessary online.
